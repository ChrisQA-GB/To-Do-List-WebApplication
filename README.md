# To-Do-List-WebApplication
This is my second project for the QA SDET cohort. This project shall display both Frontend/Backend Software development. Additionally it shall produce Unit, System and User Testing.


Coverage at 91% for Junit and Integration testing

To-Do-List WebApplication Task- Attempeted by Christopher Yiangou.

This programme is designed to be a To-Do-List aimed at kids, therefore it has a consistent pokemon asthetic. A User is desgned to enter a PokeList and then add a PokeTask to their PokeList within a local database (H2 has been enabled via the pom file in this instance ). This information is relayed from the initial Java/SpringBoot code within the java .jar file provided. It then links to a main port within your system (port 8080 was used extensively during this project, but you can change this is so desired to a more compatiable port).
The Frontend contains fetchs which catches the API links and enables the cross of hands between the front-end and backend.
This project has full CRUD functionality within the Java and Spring aspect.

## Getting Started

These instructions will enable you a cloned copy of the project, which will be up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. Using the PokePlanner-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar file that is provided in his repo will start create a connection to the localhost:8080 server. From here connect to the front end using the html files provided with the FrontEnd folder and ensure that you have downloaded LiveServer to ensure ease of use while using this project.

### Installing

To Install, clone the project your local Desktop or PC and save in a Git/Github folder.
Using an IDE open the File Column and select Open Project From File System and select the  file from whichever folder you have saved the project on.

## Running the tests

To be able to test within the IMS-Starter file navigate to the control directory and run a mvn package on the file to push any tests through the command. To manually test within Eclispse, right click on the PokePlanner project file and select run Coverage As, as a JUnit Test. 
Ensure that you have EclEmma installed within you IDE's 

### Unit Tests 

The unit tests that are within the file are essentially testing that every and all method/constructors within classes I have been able to pass the tests with at least 90% coverage. To test or add any Unit Tests, ensure that you add files within the test file and within a corresponding file.
